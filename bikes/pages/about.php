        <p>

            The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see #Legal definitions and restrictions).
            There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there are many sub-types of
            motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type, such as road racing and street bikes, or motocross and dirt bikes.
            Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road motorcycles include many types
            designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like
            the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.
            Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different riding posture.

           The first internal combustion, petroleum fuele
           d motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm
           Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany in 1885. This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of
           the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and
           motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning

            The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.
            Butler's Patent Velocycle
            The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884.
             He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884. The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich, in 1888.

        <p>

            It wasn't, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing
        </p>

        <p>

            The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5/8hp (466W) 600
            cc (40 in3; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm}) flat twin four stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery)
            equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of
            which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator
            over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the
            vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated
            lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels.
